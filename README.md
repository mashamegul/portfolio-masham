# Masham Siddiqui – Personal Portfolio Website

Website: https://masham-portfolio-2tnl9.ondigitalocean.app/

Hi! This is the source code and related files for my DECO1400 portfolio project. The assignment required us to create a website of our using using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries. I decided to create a personal portfolio website to showcase my work and skills.

In the future, I plan to expand this website to include more projects and expand on my creative section, as well as improve the design and functionality.

I made this website to show I am beyond a resume, but also a creative person who can design and build things. I hope you enjoy it!

## AI Usage

Claude was used to help clean up writing, give feedback on certain sections (like proofreading), and assist with small fixes while debugging. It was **not** used to generate or write the core content of the site, which is entirely my own work.
