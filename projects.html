Designed a conceptual system combining aerial rubbish detection with an accessible, sorting-enabled mobile bin. Led research and prototyping efforts, including environmental problem validation and system architecture mockups. Pitched the solution to industry mentors and judges, standing out among 100+ interdisciplinary teams. Solunar is an autonomous beach cleaning solution combining robotics, drones, and AI. The drone uses computer vision to identify litter on the beach, while the ground robot, guided by GPS and machine learning, collects the waste. Powered by solar energy, Solunar operates sustainably at night and serves as a mobile trash bin during the day. Its digital interface displays real-time environmental facts, encouraging community awareness. The system’s scalable design makes it adaptable for various beach sizes, and it plays a crucial role in preserving coastal environments, particularly in preparation for large events like the 2032 Olympics."
